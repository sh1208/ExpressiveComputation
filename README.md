1. fireworks
For one of the three final projects, I woud like to make an animated sketch. 
I loaded images of WhiteHouse as a background and tried to make a fireworks animaiton. 
Roughly, I made custome built CLASS (dot and firework), loaded jpeg image (whitehouse illustration)

2. fishtank
The second project was motivated by an documentary television program. I turned TV channels and watched a progrma showing undersea life. Then, I planned to make an fishtank animation, created moving fish and bubbles as well as loaded under the sea image as background. (the image source is from:https://dribbble.com/shots/1512391-Sidescroller-Game-Background-Under-the-Ocean/)
I initially wanted to make 3D fish and bublbes but changed the plan into make simple 2D figures, as background I borrowed from a website is also 2d image I want fish and bubbles to harmonize with the surrounding background.  
I added detailed comments on the code. 

3. rosarium
Last project is a still image representing rosarium. I drew four roses by making nine quads reduced gradually. Although simply drawing quads repeatedly does not seems to be a rose, I used color-changing (inner quads is more dark color than outer quads). The background greem image helps the figures to be considered as real roses in the green garden.
